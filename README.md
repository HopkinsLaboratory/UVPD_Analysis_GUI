# UVPD Analysis GUI

This repository provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) along with sample files for the analysis of variable wavelength UVPD (Ultraviolet Photodissociation) data obtained on the modified QTRAP 5500 hybrid triple-quad in the Hopkins Lab.

## Prerequisites 

This GUI requires the following Python packages: PyQt5, pyteomics, numpy, pandas, and lxml. The can be installed by opening the command prompt and entering the following command: 

pip install numpy lxml pandas PyQt5 pyteomics 

Additionally, the GUI requires Proteowizard's msconvert package. Proteowizard can be downloaded from https://proteowizard.sourceforge.io/download.html. After downloading, install the latest version to the default directory.

Once installed, add the following locations to your system's PATH, as they contain the necessary executables:

C:\Program Files (x86)\ProteoWizard\ProteoWizard 3.0.11392

C:\Program Files (x86)\ProteoWizard\ProteoWizard 3.0.11392\FileInfoToXml

(Note: The version number in the paths might vary slightly.)

These directories contain the essential msconvert.exe and fileinfotoxml.exe files. After completing these steps, you can proceed with the setup and utilization of the GUI.

## Getting Started

To launch the GUI, run `UVPD_GUI.py` located in the `GUI` directory in your preferred Python environment. Ensure that the following packages are installed: PyQt5, numpy, pandas, and pyteomics. If any of these packages are missing, you will be prompted to install them upon launching the GUI.

## GUI Initialization

Once initialized, the interface can be populated with information in the following fields:

- **Directory:** The directory containing the .wiff files. Each scan saved to the .wiff file follows the naming convention 'Laser_On_XXXnm', where XXX is the wavelength of the laser light used for UVPD.

- **Base Peak Range:** The upper and lower m/z values encompassing the parent ion peak. Enter two comma-separated numbers (e.g., 202.5, 204).

- **Fragment Ion Ranges:** The upper and lower m/z values encompassing each fragment ion formed via UVPD. Enter pairs of values enclosed by brackets and separated by commas (e.g., (50.5, 51.5),(102.5, 103.5),(125.5, 127.9).

- **Extract mzML files from .wiff checkbox:** If checked, .mzML files will be created for all scans in the specified directory. If unchecked, the code will look for .mzML files in the mzML directory (automatically created if checked).

- **Normalize to Laser Power checkbox:** If checked, normalizes photofragmentation efficiency to laser power (recommended). If unchecked, photofragmentation efficiency will not be normalized. Specify the powerdata.csv file in the corresponding dialog box.

- **Print Raw Data checkbox:** If selected, the full mass spectrum for each scan in the .wiff file will be printed to a .csv.

## Example Usage

Same data is provided to demonsate the GUI's utility:

1. Use the data in the `ExampleData_beforeAnalysis` directory.
2. Populate the GUI with the following information to mimic the outputs found in the `ExampleData_afterAnalysis` directory:

   - **Base Peak Range:** 239.0,242.0
   - **Fragment Ion Ranges:** (54.5,57.0),(114.5,116.0),(129.5,131.0),(139.5,140.5),(141.5,142.8),(153.5,154.5),(156.5,158.0),(167.5,169.0),(170.5,172.0),(180.5,181.8),(182.6,184.0),(184.5,186.0),(198.5,200.0),(208.0,210.0)
   - **Power Data Filename:** powerscan_400_600nm_120us.csv
